            The only catch? Mastering that power and being a Green Lantern means facing your fears, and for headstrong Hal Jordan, that’s
            something he’s been avoiding his whole life.When just a boy, Hal witnessed his greatest nightmare—his pilot father
            dying in a tragic plane crash. Nevertheless determined to follow in his footsteps, Hal repressed his fears, becoming
            a reckless, defiant test pilot. But when a dying alien crashes on Earth, the irresponsible Hal is chosen to be
            that alien’s successor in the Green Lantern Corps, a universe-wide peacekeeping force over 3,600 members strong.

            And his life only gets wilder from there. Alien romances. Intergalactic wars. Power-hungry super-villains. Wielding a Green
            Lantern power ring—a weapon fueled by willpower—he can fly and create constructs made of pure energy, generating
            anything from massive green fists to emerald rifles that can snipe from a planet away. But while Hal tends to
            ignore his fears, he’ll learn the only way to truly master his ring’s power is by confronting and overcoming
            them.
